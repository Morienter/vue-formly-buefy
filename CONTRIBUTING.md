It's an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!

## Issues
Before you submit an issue, please **search the issue tracker**, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we ask you to **provide a minimal reproduction scenario** that include:
- Version of the plugin used.
- Environment information (3rd-party libraries, technology stack etc.).
- A use-case that fails.

If you get stuck at any point you can create a [ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/yarbshk/vue-formly-buefy/issues).

    - The code style for the project (use our `.eslintrc`).
    - Commit message convention (sentence case, present time).
3. Do the changes in your fork.
4. **Write one or more specs** (unit-tests) for all features or bug fixes.
5. Provide documentation for all public API methods.
6. Only **if you like the change** and think **the project could use it**:

## Getting started
To **run the project for development** use the following micro guide:
1. Get local copy of the project.
2. Be sure that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and Google Chrome (needs for test) installed.
3. Kill a process which occupy the `9876` port (needs for test).
4. Set the `yarn && yarn test` command for the `client` service in the `docker-compose.yml`.
5. Open root directory of the project in the terminal and run the `docker-compose up` command.

When work has done properly all npm packages will be install and Karma test server run on the `9876` port.
